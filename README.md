# Obzidi4n's Tmux Config 

If your tmux needs are simple (and you're not a Vim person), I think you'll like this one.  

It's based on Thayer Williams' tmux.conf, so it's clean and elegant.

The 'tick' character is the hotkey.  It's underneath your tilde ~ character.

* 'tick' and + creates a tab.  (well, tick and 'equals' = really)

* 'tick' and - deletes a tab.

* 'tick' plus left/right arrow keys get you from tab to tab.
